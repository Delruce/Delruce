- ❓  Not a master of Ubuntu but trying to get familiar with
- ✅ VSCode with copilot
- ✅ Spyder/Jupyter notebook frequently being used in miniconda3
- ✅ building text-to-image applications

❓  How to understand a neural network with multiple layers?
 
- 📄😋🌬💩😋🌬💩😋🌬💩😋🌬💩✅

If 1st Amendment works:

- ❌ AutoPilot (if AutoPilot.version == L5:  it meets my expectation and need. I may buy one.)
- ❌ Twitter (we don't need a public restroom)
- ❓  Boring Co.Ltd (It offers limited options to commute)
- ❌ Neuralink (It's cool but I don't want to do any surgeries anymore)
- ❓  SpaceX (I don't like aerospace engineering even if I would like to try playing aircraft toys.)
- ❌ sleeping on floor. You must use body ammonia (C'mon is useful) to make sure spiders won't touch your stuff.
- ✅ OpenAI (It published its reinforcement learning model to play Dota2 against DeepMind AlphaStar for playing StarCraftII)
- ❌ I don't like peeping tom. AF
- ❓  College math (Don't test them in real life, or you'll find out only addition and multiplication are necessary. In other words, linear algebra)
- ❌ 6 months for building another large language model? Why not developing a real AutoPilot within half a year?
- ✅ GPT-4 (The only TA I satisfied till now. It won't mislead me and give me a negative feedback and spread negative rumor that I am stupid and lazy pursuing unreal privilege and honor and treat me as a workloader without payback.)
- ❓  BERT/ERNIE are good, but not enough.
- ❌ Curiosity is the label "sacrificing lambs" prefer to use to describe natural questioning since they are not capable of conducting research. In this way, they steal ideas => publish papers => graduate/obtain funding/gain titles. Turning a cold stone into larva requires energy, but they don't pay for it.
